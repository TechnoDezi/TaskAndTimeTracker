# Task and Time Tracker
Track tasks completed during the day and time spent on those tasks

This tool is meant as a simple task and time tracker to keep track of hours spent at a client or on a specific project.

The project is created in C# Windows Forms using RavenDB. The initial project is just to get started but will eventually be moved over to a cross platform app that hopefully will be published in all the app stores.
Keep track of billable vs non billable hours. Export to excel.
