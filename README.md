# Task and Time Tracker
Track tasks completed during the day and time spent on those tasks

This tool is meant as asimple task and time tracker to keep track of hours spent at a client or on a specific project.

The project is created in C# Windows Forms using RavenDB. The initial project is just to get started but will eventually be moved over to a cross platform app that hopefully will be published in all the app stores.
